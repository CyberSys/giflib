= The giflib API =

== Overview ==

A detailed description of the API can be found in the doc/ subdirectory.

=== Input  ===

Use DGifOpenFileHandle() or DGifOpenFileName() to get a read handle 
on a GIF file. Or use DGifOpen() to set up a read function hook.

Use DGifSlurp() to read a GIF image into code from the handle or via
the read hook. Look in the image structure members for the color
table and raster bits.

Use DGifClose() to free the read handle.

=== Output ===

Use EGifOpenFileHandle() or EGifOpenFileName() to get a write handle
on a GIF file. Or use EGifOpen() to set up a write function hook.

Use EGifSpew() to write a GIF image from appropriately populated
structures in core to the file described by the write handle or via
the write hook.

Use EGifClose() to free the write handle.

=== Errors ===

You may find the functions GifError() and GifErrorString()
useful for error handling.

=== Forward and Backward compatibility ===

If you need to write code that operates with multiple versions 
of the library, there are some useful version #defines in the
library header.  See the details in the library documentation.

=== Legacy ==

The other entry points are primarily historical.

Except for some details of extension-block handling and the addition
of read/write function hooks, the DGifSlurp()/EGifSpew() interface has
been stable since 1990.  It is expected to remain so.

== Roadmap ==

No new features are currently planned.
