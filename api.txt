= The giflib API =

== Overview ==

=== Input  ===

Use DGifOpenFileHandle() or DGifOpenFileName() to get a read handle 
on a GIF file. Or use DGifOpen() to set up a read function hook.

Use DGifSlurp() to read a GIF image into code from the handle or via
the read hook.  look in the image structure members for the RGB
bits.

Use DGifClose() to free the read handle.

=== Output ===

Use EGifOpenFileHandle() or EGifOpenFileName() to get a write handle
on a GIF file. Or use EGifOpen() to set up a write function hook.

Use EGifSpew() to write a GIF image from appropriately populated
structures in core to the file described by the write handle or via
the write hook.

Use EGifClose() to free the write handle.

=== Errors ===

You may find the functions GifError() and GifErrorString()
useful for error handling.

=== Legacy ==

The other entry points are primarily historical.

Except for some details of extension-block handling and the addition
of read/write function hooks, the DGifSlurp()/EGifSpew() interface has
been stable since 1990.  It is expected to remain so.

== Deprecation list ==

Some features will be removed in giflib 5.0:

* In the SavedImage struct: int Function will be removed.  Use
  SavedImage.ExtensionBlocks[x].Function instead.

* In gifalloc.c: MakeExtension is deprecated as well.  Use AddExtensionBlock
  instead.  (This and the previous int Function were deprecated because they
  only handle one Extension per image.  The new code handles multiple
  extensions.)

* Do not use GifBooleanType.  This is legacy from before the C
  language got booleans. It is still in the .h file, but will be 
  removed in 5.0.

* Similarly, do not use the VoidPtr macro; it is legacy from when not
  all C compilers had void *, and will be removed in 5.0

Some API calls will be renamed in 5.0:

* DrawText (and the Windows name for it created to avoid some
  collision, DrawGifText) will become GifDrawText. The other
  Draw* functions will also become GifDraw*.
