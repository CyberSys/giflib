This is giflib, a library for manipulating gif files.
Latest versions of giflib are currently hosted at:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/giflib

====
Building this package should be as simple as:

    ./configure
    gmake
    gmake install

====
Deprecation list.  Will be removed in giflib 5.0:
* In the SavedImage struct: int Function will be removed.  Use
  SavedImage.ExtensionBlocks[x].Function instead.
* In gifalloc.c: MakeExtension is deprecated as well.  Use AddExtensionBlock
  instead.  (This and the previous int Function were deprecated because they
  only handle one Extension per image.  The new code handles multiple
  extensions.)
====

automake currently generates Makefiles containing some GNUmake
specific syntax.  If you're having troubles building with your system
provided make, please install GNU make and try rebuilding.

====
This package uses autoconf, automake, and libtool to create the configure
script, so if you need to edit the configure.ac or change a makefile target
you should read the DEVELOPER file for hints on recreating the distribution
using these tools.

Good luck!
