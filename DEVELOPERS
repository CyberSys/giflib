Things to tell developers of giflib....

=======
Build Tools:
giflib presently uses autoconf, automake, and libtool in order to build
shared libraries for a wide variety of platforms.  The distributed tarball has
files prebuilt from these tools.  The repository does not.  If you want to
build giflib you will need to have these tools available.

(P.S. I use the autogen.sh script in the top level directory to generate
configure, Makefile.in, etc using these tools.)

=======
I create the distribution tar ball by using the `make dist`
command.... After hacking all I want, I check my sources into the
repository, checkout a clean tree, run ./autogen.sh; make dist and
then attempt to compile from the giflib-*.tar.gz file that is
generated.
