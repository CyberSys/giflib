= GIFLIB TODO list =

This list is short because GIFLIB is very old, very stable code with 
a very simple interface.  There are no new worlds to conquer here and
we shouldn't go looking for any, just provide a rock-solid service.

Thus: there used to be items here about redesigning the API, but
DGifSlurp()/EGifSpew() is almost all anyone ever uses. In 5.0 I've
made only the minimal interface changes required to fix some known
problems with extension-block handling and thread-safety, and to tuck
all the entry points into a namespace nothing is likely to clash with.

The utilities are historical relics mainly useful for testing, and I
(ESR) don't think we need to be competing with the likes of
ImageMagick and PIL.

Accordingly, the top to-do item is...

== Remove more features ==

Maybe we should drop gif2x11.  It's nice for testing, though.

== More regression tests ==

Not all the utilities have tests yet. See the file tests/coverage.asc.
