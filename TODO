= GIFLIB TODO list =

This list is short because GIFLIB is very old, very stable code with 
a very simple interface.  There are no worlds to conquer here and
we shouldn't go looking for any.

Thus: there used to be items on here about redesigning the API, but
DGifSlurp()/EGifSpew() is almost all anyone ever uses. The utilities
are historical relics mainly useful for testing.  Accordingly, the top
item is...

== Remove more features ==

Get rid of the GameBoy Advanced code?  The product was EOLed years ago.

Get rid of the Windows-specific code unless someone documents it.

== GIFLIB website ==

Now that we can make decent HTML from up-to-data documentation, put it up
on our hosting site.

== Clean up the extensions mess ==

* Add a function-code argument to AddExtensionBlock()
* Remove MakeExtension() and its remaining uses in icon2gif
* Remove the Function member from the image structure

This will require a break in object-library compatibility.

like giflib's ability to do Extension code was added on at a later
time and also was not implemented entirely in conformance with the
gif89a spec.  I've hacked it further to make it conform to the spec,
but it would benefit greatly from a complete rewrite.

== Security and quality ==

Make sure we set pointers that we don't fill to NULL.  (gifalloc.c seems
pretty clean.  But GifFile isn't allocated in gifalloc.c)

Make sure tmpnam is secure in gifinto.c (Use mkstemp if possible..)
