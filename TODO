= GIFLIB TODO list =

== GIFLIB website ==

Now that we can make decent HTML from up-to-data documentation, put it up
on our hosting site.

== Clean up the extensions mess ==

* Add a function-code argument to AddExtensionBlock()
* Remove MakeExtension() and its remaining uses in icon2gif
* Remove the Function member from the image structure

This will require a break in object-library compatibility.

Toshio wrote: The present Extension code is pretty hacky.  It looks
like giflib's ability to do Extension code was added on at a later
time and also was not implemented entirely in conformance with the
gif89a spec.  I've hacked it further to make it conform to the spec,
but it would benefit greatly from a complete rewrite.

== Security and quality ==

Make sure we set pointers that we don't fill to NULL.  (gifalloc.c seems
pretty clean.  But GifFile isn't allocated in gifalloc.c)

Toshio found a reported bug about libungif not handling interlaced images
correctly.  However, the latest library seems to work.  Need to figure out
what change fixed it and if it fixed it correctly or in a manner that is
apt to break later.

Make sure tmpnam is secure in gifinto.c (Use mkstemp if possible..)

Merge the windows changes from the last cvs version.  Contact Lennie Araki
about whether he is interested in maintaining the windows changes

Run the utils through indent

delete things from there.  Some is in my mailbox at home.  Others were
on the old CVS server.  I think most of the CVS backlog has been
merged but I've just started ot look at the stuff at home.
