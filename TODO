= GIFLIB TODO list =

This list is short because GIFLIB is very old, very stable code with 
a very simple interface.  There are no new worlds to conquer here and
we shouldn't go looking for any, just provide a rock-solid service.

Thus: there used to be items on here about redesigning the API, but
DGifSlurp()/EGifSpew() is almost all anyone ever uses. The utilities
are historical relics mainly useful for testing, and I (ESR) don't
think we need to be competing with the likes of ImageMagick and PIL.

Accordingly, the top to-do item is...

== Remove more features ==

Get rid of the Windows-specific code unless someone documents it.

Maybe we should even drop gif2x11.  It's nice for testing, though.

== More regression tests ==

Not all the utilities have tests yet.  Idempotency checks on some of the
conversions that are invertible would be good ideas.  See the file 
tests/coverage.txt.
